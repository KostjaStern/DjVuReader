### Notes
  - To run TestFX tests on **macOS**, check the following system settings (see https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX/issues/641):
      * Go to System Settings > Security & Privacy > Accessibility
        * If you’re running tests from your **IDE**, enable your IDE in the list.
        * If you’re running tests from **Maven/Gradle** in the **Terminal** app, enable **Terminal**.
