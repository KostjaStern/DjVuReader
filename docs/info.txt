> The ckSize is a logical block size—how many data bytes are in ckData. If ckData is an odd number of bytes long, a 0 pad byte follows which is not included in ckSize. 
  (Cf. Alignment.) A chunk’s total physical size is ckSize rounded up to an even number plus the size of the header. So the smallest chunk is 8 bytes long with ckSize = 0. 
  For the sake of following chunks, programs must respect every chunk’s ckSize as a virtual end-of-file for reading its ckData even if that data is malformed, e.g., 
  if nested contents are truncated.
